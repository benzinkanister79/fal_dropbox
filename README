It extends FAL to connect to your dropbox account in file list module

6i.) After successful connection click save in FlexForm again.
6j.) With a little bit of luck you should be connected now (green text)

7.) Have fun with FAL Dropbox

Hint:
- fal_dropbox does not using caching for now...so it is very slow at the moment
- fal_dropbox can not create a new file. You only can upload a new file
- you can create folders
- you can navigate through the folders
- it's good to deactivate "show thunbnails", because we don't have a valid path to the images
- nothing more tested. I don't believe that you can access the files with content elements because getFileContent was not filled with logic.
