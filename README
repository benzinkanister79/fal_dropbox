ToDo:
- rename folder
- delete folder
- it would be cool to remove all the big packages like oauth, HTTP_Request2 and so on
--> I tried to change HTTP_Request with my own little Request-Object (fsockopen)

Done:
- you can create folders
- you can navigate through the folders
- move files
- copy files
- create references to tt_content records
- show image in popUp
- rename file
- creation of thumbs works
- copy files to upload folder
