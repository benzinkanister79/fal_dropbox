fal_dropbox is an extension for TYPO3 >= 6.0.0
It extends FAL to connect to your dropbox account in file list module

INSTALL

1.) Install and activate fal_dropbox extension in Ext-Manager
2.) Maybe it's a TYPO3-Core Bug. But after installing this extension you have to compare your datebase in INSTALL_TOOL
2.) Create a new file storage record on pid 0 called "Dropbox"
3.) On Tab "Configuration" choose "Dropbox". FlexForm reloads
3a.) GoTo: https://www.dropbox.com/developers
3b.) Create your own Dropbox App "MyApps" (maybe you must login first)
3c.) Give it a name and a description
3d.) Please choose "App folder". "Full Dropbox" is just not implemented in this extension
3e.) Now you should see the data of your app. Copy the data to FlexForm (AppKey/AppSecret)
3f.) Save
3g.) After saving a Dropbox Link appears
3h.) Click it and allow your app to connect to your dropbox account
3i.) After successful connection click save in FlexForm again.
3j.) With a little bit of luck you should be connected now (green text)

4.) Have fun with FAL Dropbox

ToDo:
- rename folder
- delete folder
- it would be cool to remove all the big packages like oauth, HTTP_Request2 and so on
--> I tried to change HTTP_Request with my own little Request-Object (fsockopen)

Done:
- you can create folders
- you can navigate through the folders
- move files
- copy files
- create references to tt_content records
- show image in popUp
- rename file
- creation of thumbs works
- copy files to upload folder
