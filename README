fal_dropbox is an extension for TYPO3 >= 6.0.0
It extends FAL to connect to your dropbox account in file list module

INSTALL

1.) Install and activate fal_dropbox extension
2.) Create a new file storage record on pid 0 called "Dropbox"
3.) On Tab "Configuration" choose "Dropbox". FlexForm reloads
3a.) GoTo: https://www.dropbox.com/developers
3b.) Create your own Dropbox App "MyApps" (maybe you must login first)
3c.) Give it a name and a description
3d.) Please choose "App folder". "Full Dropbox" is just not implemented in this extension
3e.) Now you should see the data of your app. Copy the data to FlexForm (AppKey/AppSecret)
3f.) Save
3g.) After saving a Dropbox Link appears
3h.) Click it and allow your app to connect to your dropbox account
3i.) After successful connection click save in FlexForm again.
3j.) With a little bit of luck you should be connected now (green text)

4.) Have fun with FAL Dropbox

Hint:
- fal_dropbox does not using caching for now...so it is very slow at the moment
- fal_dropbox can not create a new file. You only can upload a new file
- you can create folders
- you can navigate through the folders
- it's good to deactivate "show thunbnails", because we don't have a valid path to the images
- nothing more tested. I don't believe that you can access the files with content elements because getFileContent was not filled with logic.
